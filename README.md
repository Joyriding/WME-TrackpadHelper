# WME-TrackpadHelper

Makes panning the map on a laptop slightly less frustrating by hiding the mouse cursor when the trackpad is clicked or dragged. When the trackpad is clicked a second time or dragging stops then the mouse cursor reappears in the same spot as it was.

Create a bookmarklet using [WME-TrackpadHelper-bookmarklet.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joyriding/WME-TrackpadHelper/main/wme-trackpadhelper-bookmarklet-min.js?token=AJPPHOLIIB744QX32N75RA27X2BLG) and click it to enable/disable this behavior. 

See [Issues](https://github.com/Joyriding/WME-TrackpadHelper/issues) for known problems. You will not want to keep this enabled at all times as it makes working with objects on the map difficult or impossible. (For example, selecting a segment or place requires a second click to release the mouse pointer.)

If the mouse cursor ever gets lost, press Esc to release it.
